Track stacks of Grim Focus and its morphs and displays
them in a visual and obvious way.

## Purpose
_But there are already buff trackers that display how many 
stacks there are. Why do I need this?_

That's true. Several existing buff trackers already provide 
this capability, but how they display this information is less 
than ideal. Having a large stack display is more useful and 
obvious than a small text counter that can become lost among
other information or is difficult to see, especially if you're 
visually impaired.

As one of the nightblade's key class abilities, 
successful and timely procs of the spectral bow is crucial 
to effective PvE DPS and lining up devastating burst in PvP.

This add-on aims to provide a lightweight and useful option 
for those who need a more obvious cue, don't run other buff 
trackers, or enjoy filling their screen with flair.

## Functionality
The stack display does not appear until the first stack, 
avoiding screen clutter while out of combat. Each stack will 
appear as they happen and disappears when the buff expires or
the proc is used.

This add-on is _not_ intended to be a tracker for uptime on 
Grim Focus (or its morphs), just for the unique stacking mechanic.

## Implemented Features
- Tracks Grim Focus, Merciless Resolve, Relentless Focus stacks
- Movable stack display to any place on the screen
	- To move, stack one or more times, enter cursor mode and drag into position

## Planned Features
- Robust settings menu
- Varied and unique display styles (current implementation non-final)
- Support for Lock/unlock of display element with more intuitive positioning
- Customization of colors, sizes, and more

## Feedback & Contributing
If you'd like to provide feedback, drop me a mail in-game to
@g4rr3t. Any ideas of unique, interesting, and useful ways to 
display the stacks are welcome -- especially supporting artwork.

# Enjoy!
