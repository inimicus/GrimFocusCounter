[SIZE=4][B][COLOR=Wheat]Purpose[/COLOR][/B][/SIZE]

[COLOR=Plum][I]But there are already buff trackers that display how many stacks there are. Why do I need this?[/I][/COLOR]

That's true. Several existing buff trackers already provide this capability, but how they display this information is less than ideal. Having a large stack display is more useful and obvious than a small text counter that can become lost among other information or is difficult to see, especially if you're visually impaired.

As one of the nightblade's key class abilities, successful and timely procs of the spectral bow is crucial to effective PvE DPS and lining up devastating burst in PvP.

This add-on aims to provide a lightweight and useful option for those who need a more obvious cue, don't run other buff trackers, or enjoy filling their screen with flair.

[SIZE=4][B][COLOR=Wheat]Functionality[/COLOR][/B][/SIZE]
The stack display can be configured to not appear until the first stack occurs or upon activation of the skill. Each stack will update the display as they happen and returns to a zero state or disappears when the buff expires or the proc is used -- depending on selected options.

This add-on is not intended to be a tracker for uptime on Grim Focus (or its morphs), just for the unique stacking mechanic.
